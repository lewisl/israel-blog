					<description><![CDATA[Hebron was made &#039;Judenrein&#039; when the Arab population slaughtered their Jewish neighbors in a pogrom in 1929.  The survivors fled in terror.  Prior to that time, Hebron was nearly one-half Jewish.

Hebron is also in the territory allocated to Israel as part of the 1947 partition plan.  It was captured by Jordan when Arab armies attacked in 1948.  So its recapture in 1967 merely re-established the situation to where it was originally supposed to have been.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I, too, was overwhelmed by Judah and the testimony of the soldiers. It is a vivid glimpse into what happens when good people are trapped by a military machine that takes on a life of its own. The important thing to realize is these soldiers end up feeling so powerless that they become numb. Breaking the Silence enables them to feel human again. I am glad NIF funds this group.

					<description><![CDATA[I should probably add some corrections:
- Most of the Israeli public and policians support a 2-state solution.  The disagreement is over what Israel might be willing to give up to the Palistinian state.  Public support within Israel for the Jewish settlements in the West Bank is declining though existing settlements are still expanding.  It is not at all easy to see Israel giving back all of the settlements and it is not all easy to see Palestinians accepting only the few places where Israel has granted limited autonomy to date.
- As challenging as the Israeli political situation is, at least Israel has a government.  There are no really stable institutions in the West Bank or in the Gaza Strip.  It&#039;s just not clear who can or will participate in negotiations with Israel.

					<description><![CDATA[Turns out there are non-Kosher McDonalds as well.  There is one non-Kosher McDonalds in the center of Jerusalem that is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  They have cheeseburgers.  Some rabbi got paid off to allow this.
