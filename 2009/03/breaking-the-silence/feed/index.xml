					<description><![CDATA[Hebron was made &#039;Judenrein&#039; when the Arab population slaughtered their Jewish neighbors in a pogrom in 1929.  The survivors fled in terror.  Prior to that time, Hebron was nearly one-half Jewish.

Hebron is also in the territory allocated to Israel as part of the 1947 partition plan.  It was captured by Jordan when Arab armies attacked in 1948.  So its recapture in 1967 merely re-established the situation to where it was originally supposed to have been.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I, too, was overwhelmed by Judah and the testimony of the soldiers. It is a vivid glimpse into what happens when good people are trapped by a military machine that takes on a life of its own. The important thing to realize is these soldiers end up feeling so powerless that they become numb. Breaking the Silence enables them to feel human again. I am glad NIF funds this group.
