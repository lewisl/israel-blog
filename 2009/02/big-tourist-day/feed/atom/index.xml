					<content type="html" xml:base="./../../comment-page-1/index.html#comment-15"><![CDATA[<p>Just a couple of other notes on Masada:<br />
Actually, something like 26 human skeletal remains have been found:  far too few to support the mythology of the mass suicide to avoid Roman slavery.  Also, the most significant skeletons that were later given a full Israeli military burial were found with pig bones amongst the human bones.  So, the humans were probably Roman soldiers not Jewish zealots.  Let&#8217;s just say a lot of the military mythology of Masada has been tarnished.   Also, nearly full head of hair found in one of the graves is unlikely to be the hair of a female Jewish martyr.  If it were, the hair ends would have roots.  But, the hair appears to have been sheered off&#8211;there were no roots.  So, this is probably the hair of a female captive.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="./../../comment-page-1/index.html#comment-13"><![CDATA[<p>Great comment on the swimsuits; this is the place where an 8 year old Daniel once asked, &#8220;Daddy, how come Israeli men are so fat and wear those little swimsuits?&#8221;<br />
Wasn&#8217;t the Massada water cistern system amazing?<br />
Sounds like you have a great guide who&#8217;s general outlook on the situation is close to yours too.</p>
