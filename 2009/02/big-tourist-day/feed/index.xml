					<description><![CDATA[Just a couple of other notes on Masada:
Actually, something like 26 human skeletal remains have been found:  far too few to support the mythology of the mass suicide to avoid Roman slavery.  Also, the most significant skeletons that were later given a full Israeli military burial were found with pig bones amongst the human bones.  So, the humans were probably Roman soldiers not Jewish zealots.  Let&#039;s just say a lot of the military mythology of Masada has been tarnished.   Also, nearly full head of hair found in one of the graves is unlikely to be the hair of a female Jewish martyr.  If it were, the hair ends would have roots.  But, the hair appears to have been sheered off--there were no roots.  So, this is probably the hair of a female captive.

It&#039;s Jay, Susie, Emmy, and the best one of all, Ellie.
We miss you a lot and you&#039;re pictures are &#039;ballin&#039; (real gangsta... chea bro)
Mom would like to say she loved the dead sea and we all think that your next picture should be you covered in mud.
WE LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU A LOT.
Love, US!
PS - Ellie got you a hilarious gift from Mexico. She thinks you will love it, because, if you don&#039;t she will kill you.
PPS- Jay is excited for when you return because he really wants to run the remote controlled cars with you.
WE LOVE YOUUU.

					<description><![CDATA[Great comment on the swimsuits; this is the place where an 8 year old Daniel once asked, &quot;Daddy, how come Israeli men are so fat and wear those little swimsuits?&quot;
Wasn&#039;t the Massada water cistern system amazing?
Sounds like you have a great guide who&#039;s general outlook on the situation is close to yours too.
